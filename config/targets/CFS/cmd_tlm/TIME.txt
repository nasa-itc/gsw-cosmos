COMMAND CFE CFE_TIME_ADD_1HZADJ <%= CosmosCfsConfig::PROCESSOR_ENDIAN %> "This command has been updated to take actual sub-seconds (1/2^32 seconds) rather than micro-seconds as an input argument. This change occurred after the determination was made that one micro-second is too large an increment for a constant 1Hz adjustment. This command continuously adjusts the Spacecraft Time Correlation Factor (STCF) every second, by adding the specified value. The adjustment to the STCF is applied in the Time Service local 1Hz interrupt handler. As the local 1Hz interrupt is not synchronized to the tone signal, one cannot say when the adjustment will occur, other than once a second, at about the same time relative to the tone. There was some debate about whether the maximum 1Hz clock drift correction factor would ever need to exceed some small fraction of a second. But, the decision was made to provide the capability to make 1Hz adjustments greater than one second and leave it to the ground system to provide mission specific limits."

Use of FLYWHEEL mode is mainly for debug purposes although in extreme circumstances, it may be of value to force Time Service not to rely on normal time updates.

Note also that setting the clock state to VALID or INVALID on a Time Client that is currently getting time updates from the Time Server will have very limited effect.
